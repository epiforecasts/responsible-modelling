*Draft schedule*

The day is designed to be interactive, with a focus on reflection, discussion, and co-designing practical resources.

Each session uses a [*What / So What / Now What*](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/) structure, building up from panels and mixed breakout formats for group discussion.
