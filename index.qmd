## Key details

- **Date:** 24 March 2026

- **Location:** London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT

:::

How do we evaluate modelling work, and what does that imply about modelling responsibly?
We're aiming to bring together perspectives on model evaluation across epidemiological and public health contexts. 
We'll collaboratively map out professional norms, values, and responsibilities, and experiment with putting this into practice by co-designing training material for responsible modellers.

The day is structured around two complementary themes:

- **Epidemiology, evaluation, and scientific responsibility** 
- **Public health, values, and social responsibility**

The day closes with a joint priority-setting exercise, drawing across both themes to create a practical resource for considering responsibility in infectious disease modelling.
