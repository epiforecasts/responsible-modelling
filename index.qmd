What does responsible modelling look like?

While epidemiological modelling expands in capacity and visibility, professional norms for evaluation and ethical conduct are still taking shape.

This one-day workshop brings together the infectious disease modelling community to build a shared understanding of what responsibility means in practice, addressing questions across model design, implementation, and use.

Centring evaluation, we will examine both the scientific validity and social legitimacy of epidemiological models. 

Together, we will:

- Compare technical evaluation approaches across epidemiological contexts, from sustained control programmes to real-time outbreak response
- Identify the role of expertise and value judgement when developing models for public health action
- Learn from peers' experiences while building a community of practice

Through expert-led sessions and collaborative discussion, we will identify opportunities to strengthen responsible practices in our own work and the wider field.
