### How do we evaluate modelling work, and what does that imply about modelling responsibly?

:::{.panel-tabset}
## Overview

We're inviting participants to join a one day workshop on evaluation and responsibility in infectious disease modelling. Through the day, we'll:

- compare perspectives on evaluation in epidemiological and public health contexts
- collaboratively map out what this means for professional norms, values, and responsibilities
- experiment with what this looks like in practice by co-designing training material for modellers 

We intend to directly support participants by building up practical ideas, resources, and relationships.
While we anticipate a UK focus, we welcome contributions from any context.

We encourage participants from all career experiences and interests to join us.
