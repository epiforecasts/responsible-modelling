:::

We are convening a one-day workshop (24 March 2026, LSHTM) to explore scientific and social responsibilities in modelling. 
We aim to build a shared understanding of how modelling work is evaluated across epidemiological and public health contexts. 
Working from this, we will collaboratively draw out professional norms, values, and expectations. 
Then we'll test what this looks like in practice by co-designing training material for responsible modellers.

The day is structured around two complementary themes:

- **Epidemiology, evaluation, and scientific responsibility** 
- **Public health, values, and social responsibility**

The day closes with a joint priority-setting exercise, drawing on both themes to identify practical ideas and resources for embedding responsibility into modelling work.
