## Overview

We're inviting participants to join a one day workshop on evaluation and responsibility in infectious disease modelling. Through the day, we'll:

-   compare perspectives on evaluation in epidemiological and public health contexts
-   collaboratively map out what this means for professional norms, values, and responsibilities
-   experiment with what this looks like in practice by co-designing training material for modellers

We intend to directly support participants by building up practical ideas, resources, and relationships. While we anticipate a UK focus, we welcome contributions from any context. We encourage participants from all career experiences and interests to join.
