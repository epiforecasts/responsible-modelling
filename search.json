    "text": "This one-day workshop brings together the infectious disease modelling community to build a shared understanding of what responsibility means in practice.\nCentring evaluation, we will investigate both the scientific validity and social legitimacy of epidemiological modelling. Together, we will:\n\nCompare technical evaluation approaches across epidemiological contexts, from sustained control programmes to real-time outbreak response\nIdentify the role of expertise and value judgement when developing models for public health action\nLearn from peers’ experiences while building a community of practice around responsible modelling\n\nThrough expert-led sessions and collaborative discussion, we will identify opportunities to strengthen responsible practices in our own work and the wider field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey details\n\n\n\n\nDate: 24 March 2026\nTiming: 09.00 - 16.00\nLocation: London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT\nParticipants: approx. 50 participants across academia and public health\n\n\n\n\nOrganised by Kath Sherratt (LSHTM), Seb Funk (LSHTM), and Erica Thompson (UCL), and supported by LSHTM CMMID"
