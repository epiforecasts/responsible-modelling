    "text": "Date: 24 March 2026\nLocation: London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK\n\nThis one-day workshop brings together the infectious disease modelling community to explore responsible practices across the modelling lifecycle. With a strong focus on evaluation, we will explore both the scientific and social roles of modelling to explore what “responsible modelling” looks like in epidemiology.\nTogether, we aim to:\n\nContrast key issues in technical model evaluation across different epidemiological contexts, from long-term control programmes to real-time outbreak response\nExplore the role of values and biases in modelling choices, and consider evaluating modelling as a decision-making tool\nBuild connections among a community of practice committed to responsible modelling in epidemiology\n\nWe plan an interactive mix of expert-led talks and experience-led discussion. Enrollment is limited to 50 participants to facilitate discussion.\n\nOrganised by Kath Sherratt (LSHTM), Seb Funk (LSHTM), and Erica Thompson (UCL), and supported by LSHTM CMMID"
