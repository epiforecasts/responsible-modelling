We’re aiming to bring together perspectives on model evaluation across epidemiological and public health contexts. We’ll collaboratively map out professional norms, values, and responsibilities, and experiment with putting this into practice by co-designing training material for responsible modellers.\nThe day is structured around two complementary themes:\n\nEpidemiology, evaluation, and scientific responsibility\nPublic health, values, and social responsibility\n\nThe day closes with a joint priority-setting exercise, drawing across both themes to create a practical resource for considering responsibility in infectious disease modelling.\n\nOrganised by Kath Sherratt (LSHTM), Seb Funk (LSHTM), and Erica Thompson (UCL), and supported by LSHTM CMMID"
